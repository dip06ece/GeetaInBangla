    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: <strong>December 1, 2025</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Geeta In Bangla</strong> ("the App") is an Android app available from
      <a href="https://dip06ece.github.io/GeetaInBangla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dip06ece.github.io/GeetaInBangla/</a>.
      This Privacy Policy explains how the App collects, uses, and shares information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <p>The App does NOT require you to create an account. You are not required to provide personal information (name, email, etc.) to use the App.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Local data stored on your device</h3>
    <p>The App saves certain data locally on your device for app functionality, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> when you save a bookmark, it is stored in a local file (e.g., <code>bookmarks.json</code>) inside the app's internal storage. This file is not uploaded to any server by default.</li>
      <li><strong>Settings and preferences:</strong> theme, last-read position, or other preferences stored locally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Network requests and streaming</h3>
    <p>The App streams audio files from remote URLs. Example sources may include <code>https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/</code> or public Google Drive links if you configure them. When streaming, the App makes network requests to those remote servers and therefore the remote server may receive network metadata (e.g., request IP, user-agent) according to that server's logging and policies.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> bookmarks and other local data are not sent to our servers unless you explicitly export or share them from within the app (no automatic uploads).
    </div>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above only to provide and maintain App functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stream audio content requested by you.</li>
      <li>Save and load bookmarks and preferences locally to improve your experience.</li>
      <li>Troubleshoot issues if you share logs or files with the developer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may load audio files from third-party servers (for example, remote hosting or Google Drive). We do not control these third-party servers — please review their privacy policies if you are concerned about how they handle access logs or analytics.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you later enable or integrate third-party services (such as analytics, crash reporting, AdMob, Firebase, or social login), this privacy policy will be updated to reflect that. Please check the "Changes" section below for updates.</p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request one or more of the following Android permissions depending on features you use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>INTERNET</code> — required to stream audio from remote URLs.</li>
      <li>Other permissions (e.g., external storage access) are requested only if you enable features that need them. If you see additional permission prompts, those permissions will be described in-app when they are needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share the personal information you provide to third parties, except in the limited cases described below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When you explicitly export or share bookmark data or files from the app (for example, via email or file sharing), you are choosing to send that data to a third party.</li>
      <li>To comply with applicable law or legal process, or to protect rights, property, or safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data stored locally on the device. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is perfectly secure. If you choose to export bookmarks or files from the app, treat them as you would any local file and avoid sharing sensitive information.</p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. If you believe we may have collected information from a child under 13, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after changes indicates your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>9. How to Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you want to request deletion of local data or report an issue, please contact the developer:</p>
